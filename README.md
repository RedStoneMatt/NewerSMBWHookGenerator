# NewerSMBWHookGenerator
A very little software for making NewerSMBW Custom Sprite Hooks, works most of the time but not everytime due to some sprite profiles not being able to be replaced without breaking the game.

# Main Usage
Basically, if you want to make a NewerSMBW custom sprite, put in the software the actor you want it to replace, its name and its source file name.

You can also put a function that load the arc files you need, as well as setting the default spawning positions and draw distances.

Then after filling all the needed infos, the software will generate a hook for your sprite.

If you don't understand, you can click Help -> Get an example


You can then copy the output from the output text box, or save it as a yaml file from the File Drop Down Menu

# Other features
In the "Tools" Drop Down Menu, there is some tools such as a useless Kamek-instances-switching tool, a broken decimal-to-hex calculator, a tool to convert addresses from regions of the game to other regions of the game based on [Treeki's mapfile_tool.py](https://github.com/Treeki/NewerSMBW/blob/no-translations/Kamek/tools/mapfile_tool.py), and a tool that i prefer not to document as i made just for me because i needed it but will be useless to anyone else.

In short: do not use these :p

# Bug Reports
If you find bugs, you can contact me on discord: [RedStoneMatt#2826](https://discord.gg/s73Eknd)

Though it's very likely that it doesn't get fixed until a long time, since this tool is kinda old and badly programmed.
